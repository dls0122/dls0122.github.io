<br>Course Objectives
<br>Explain, implement, and apply the following data-structures:

<br>lists (unordered and ordered),
<br>stacks,
<br>queues,
<br>expression trees,
<br>binary search trees,
<br>heaps, and hash tables
<br>Analyze the time and space complexity of algorithms using asymptotic upper bounds (big-O notation).
<br>Explain and use references and linked structures.
<br>Outline basic object-oriented design concepts: composition, inheritance, polymorphism.
<br>Outline basic concepts of immutable data structures and explain the trade-offs compared to mutable data.
<br>Write and test recursive procedures, and explain the run-time stack concept.
<br>Analyze searching and sorting algorithms, and explain their relationship to data-structures.
<br>Choose and implement appropriate data-structures to solve an application problem.
<br>Understand techniques of software development, such as unit testing and version control.
