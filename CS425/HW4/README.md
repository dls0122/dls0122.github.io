Use your HW2 and PostgreSQL DBMS.
Create table(s) in your database as you design by the HW2 (like HW3).
Do the following actions with SQL queries.
1. Create at least 10 different subqueries (with problem statement what to
query) to search data using a table (or more than two relations – you can
use the same relations of HW2 or you can use another relation(s) for HW3).
2. If you can get the same result without using subqueries as item1, use the
alternative queries and results. (you don’t need to do all subqueries of
item1 because some results must use the subquery technique).
3. Save all above SQL queries with a proper query title in your DB.
A PPT file:
The first slide includes your database title and your name.
The second slide shows your DB design (ERD) of HW2.
The 3rd slide lists table of metadata of the relation(s) you implement in the DB.
Later slides show each SQL query and screen shot of the result per slide.
If you have item2 (alternative query without using subquery), show both queries
and results of screenshots per the same slide (If you cannot show both cases in a
slide due to size of the screen, use immediate next slide).
Submission: (Do not compress files)
1. Your PostgreSQL DB file. (if you use the same one as HW2/HW3, do not
need to resubmit)
2. A PPT file
3. (optional) MS Word or PDF file if you want to explain any additional note
how to run your DB in the PostgreSQL.
