CS425 BE Project
Use your HW2/HW3/HW4 to build a DB with the PostgreSQL DBMS.
Create table(s) in your database as you design by the HW2/HW3/HW4.
Do the following actions with SQL queries.
1. Complete your database design (ERD) into PostgreSQL DB.
2. Every relation must have at least 10 records (except some relations cannot
have that many rows in special case – your judge is needed)
3. With either psql (command line interface connect to the database) or
pgAdmin (web base interface) to run the query and get the results.
(research the tutorial https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/connect-topostgresql-database/ ) * strongly suggest to use pgAdmin at this time.
4. You can build a small database of your previous design (to
add/delete/update data)
A PPT file:
The first slide includes your database title and your name.
The second slide shows your entire DB design (ERD).  you can modify or slightly
redesign (change) your database model at this time since HWs.
Show table of metadata of the all relation(s) you implement in the DB.
Later slides show each SQL query and screen shot of the result per slide. (you can
also use the HW3 and HW4 slides but need more).
Submission: (Do not compress files)
1. Your PostgreSQL DB file.
2. MS Word format: User document (how to use your database for people
who use it at the first time. Starting from how to start your database, how
to use, how to change data, what to search to get, etc… think about any
user manual to use any product if you buy)
3. MS PPT format: screen shots of your database and samples (some students
can think item2 and item3 use the same screenshots. Yes, you can but the
MS Word format uses small picture with articles, MS PPT file shows bigger
screenshots for detail)
4. Self evaluation and future plan document: if you cannot implement some
parts, list them. If you have any future plan to add later, list them.
