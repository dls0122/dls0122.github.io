Use your HW2 to implement the DB with the PostgreSQL DBMS.
Create table(s) in your database as you design by the HW2.
Do the following actions with SQL queries.
1. Create at least one or two tables of the HW2 design.
2. Insert at least 10 records (rows) into each table using SQL queries.
3. Modify (add and delete) columns of a table using SQL queries.
4. Delete a column of a table using SQL queries.
5. Restore the deleted column to the table by item 4 using SQL queries.
6. Remove one table using SQL queries.
7. Restore the removed table by item 6 using SQL queries.
8. Create at least 10 different queries to search data using a table.
9. Save all above SQL queries with a proper query title in your DB.
A PPT file:
The first slide includes your database title and your name.
The second slide shows your DB design (ERD) of HW2.
The 3rd slide lists table of metadata of the relation(s) you implement in the DB.
• Metadata tables must view as detail as you can
• i.e. min/max value, required/optional, type of data, length of characters,
etc.
Later slides show each SQL query and screen shot of the result per slide.
One query/screenshot(s) per slide.
Submission: (Do not compress files ever: no zip, no rar, NO compress format)
1. Your PostgreSQL DB file.
2. One PPT file
3. (optional) MS Word or PDF file if you want to explain any additional note
how to run your DB in the PostgreSQL.
