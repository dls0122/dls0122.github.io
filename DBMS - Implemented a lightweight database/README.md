CS 525 Advanced Database Organization
<br>Databases management systems are a crucial part of most large-scale industry and open-source systems. This course provides comprehensive coverage of issues associated with database system development and an in-depth examination of structures and techniques used in contemporary database management systems (DBMSs). Students will learn about the inner workings of these exciting systems: Which algorithms are used? What are typical architectures used to build a system as complex as a DBMS? What are implementation strategies? These questions and more will be answered during the course.

The course is highly applied, emphasizing practical skills and habits through a series of programming assignments during which students will develop their own tiny DBMS like engine. We will cover the most important aspects/components of a DBMS: storage and buffer management, indexing, query optimization, query execution, and concurrency control and recovery.

<br>[Assignment 1](http://cs.iit.edu/~cs525/assign1.html) - Storage Manager: Implement a storage manager that allows read/writing of blocks to/from a file on disk
<br>[Assignment 2](http://cs.iit.edu/~cs525/assign2.html) - Buffer Manager: Implement a buffer manager that manages a buffer of blocks in memory including reading/flushing to disk and block replacement (flushing blocks to disk to make space for reading new blocks from disk)
<br>[Assignment 3](http://cs.iit.edu/~cs525/assign3.html) - Record Manager: Implement a simple record manager that allows navigation through records, and inserting and deleting records
<br>[Assignment 4](http://cs.iit.edu/~cs525/assign4.html) - B+-Tree Index: Implement a disk-based B+-tree index structure
